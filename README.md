## Background
Districts submit and interact with their graduation cohort data in two ways:
1. Districts enter graduation-related data (e.g., completion types, withdrawal codes, etc. into their __Student Information Systems__ (SIS).
2. These data feed into the tables in EIS that are the backend for the __Cohort application__, where districts submit documentation to request certain students exclusion from the cohort.

Please note that the department must make manual updates to EIS data tables in EIS in rare cases. Please consult [Appendix B](#appendixB) for more details on these edge cases.

## Process phases 
The annual graduation cohort process occurs in four phases.

| __Phase__ | __Description of Required Actions__ | __Person(s) Responsible__ | __Timeline__ |
| Ongoing | Submit questions not addressed in guidance documents to [TNED.Graduates@tn.gov](mailto:TNED.Graduates@tn.gov) | District personnel | Ongoing | 
| Ongoing | Respond to submitted questions; see [Appendix B]{#appendix} for common questions and responses | Accountability Project Manager | Ongoing |
